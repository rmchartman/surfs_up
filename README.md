# Surfs Up

## Overview
The dream of living in Hawaii is about to come true, as long as there is sufficient proof to inventor W. Avy that a surf and shake shop for ice cream and surfing gear will be a profitable investment year round. After providing statistics on precipitation and temperatures for the previous year, W. Avy requested more information on temperature data over several years before backing the surf shop. Specifically, he requested temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
Looking at the temperature summary statistics below:
- June temperatures are higher than December temperatures on average by approximately four degrees.
- Even though the range for the temperatures in December is larger than June, the standard deviations are relatively similar, putting high confidence in the variability of the temperature over different times of year.
- June contained more data elements than December (1700 vs 1517), meaning that the December data accuracy could be improved with a simiar number of counts as June. 

### June Temperatures
Here are the results of the data for June over a seven year period (2010-2017).

### December Temperatures
Here are the results of the data for Decemeber over a seven year period (2010-2017).

## Summary
After reviewing the data for June and December, it appears that the temperatures are similar enough that the surf and shake shop will have not problem being successful if success is dependent on temperature alone. In order to make a more informed decision on the weather difference between June and December, precipitation for these months should be analyzed, as well as cloudiness versus sunniness to derermine the likelyhood of good waves and ice cream sales.
